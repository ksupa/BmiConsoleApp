# BMI Console App

This project uses classes, objects, properties, and methods to illustrate the principles of C#. User information like Name, Height, and Weight are stored in the Client class, which also includes a CalculateBMI() method for handling BMI calculations. 

As users add clients they are stored into a CSV file and are able to be accessed even after the program is closed and reopened. 

Basic console input/output, conditional logic for BMI evaluation, and object instantiation for user data management are all elements of the program. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and clean code organization by segregating BMI logic into the Client class.
